        <h2>_The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_<br>
            ACT-III<br></h2>
<h3>            SCENE.
    _The Library in Lord Goringâ€™s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
    the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
    smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
    drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
    some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
    impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
    Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
    intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
    the dominance of form_.
    
    [_Enter_ LORD GORING _in evening dress with a buttonhole_.  _He is
    wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  _White-gloved_, _he carries a
    Louis Seize cane_.  _His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion_.
    _One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life_, _makes it
    indeed_, _and so masters it_.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
    in the history of thought_.] <br> </h3>

    <h4 class="name LORD-GORING"> LORD GORING.</h4>  
    <p class = "speech">Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
    of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p>
    
    <h4 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h4>

    <p class="speech"> You see, Phipps, Fashion is
    what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>
