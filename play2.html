<h4 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h4>  <p class=speech> Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?  Some
extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.</p>
<p class="speech-direction">  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERhSHAM.] </p>
<p class=speech>Delighted to see you, my dear father.</p> 
<p class="speech-direction"> [_Goes to meet him_.]</p>

<h4 class="name LORD-CAVERSHMAN">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>
<p>  Take my cloak off.</p>

<h4 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h4>  
<p>Is it worth while, father?

LORD CAVERSHAM Of course it is worth while, sir.  Which is the most
comfortable chair?</p>

<h4 class="name LORD-CAVERSHMAN">LORD GORING</h4>
  <p>This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I
have visitors</p>

<h4 class="name LORD-CAVERSHMAN">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  
<p>Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room?</p>

<h4 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h4>  
<p>No, father.</p>
